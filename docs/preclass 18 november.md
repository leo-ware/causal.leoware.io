- In this round, I will focus on learning about the design process in the visual arts and how this can be applied to software development/my capstone
- My intended approach is to work with my friends who are more interested in the visual design process/familiar with it, and work with them on a couple of small projects. I am going to go draw at a cafe with them to learn about the process.
- I will submit my drawings from cafe sessions and a short document of thoughts on the design process and what can be transferred.

Right now, I'm focused more on studying the process of design than implementing it. That said, one idea that keeps coming up is the idea of iteration and self-critique. My friend Andre, who is really good at design, says these are really important skills that you need to consciously develop.

I will teach about different brainstorming techniques.

I have chosen to focus on \#designthinking and \#critique. These tie very closely to ideas about the design process and iterative creation. So, I think they are very relevant.

I don't really have any questions right now.
