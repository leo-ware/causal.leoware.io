Causal inference is a set of techniques for solving one simple problem: *what would happen if we did something different?* It's the study of how changes to our actions change the world.

To understand what this means, we can constrast this to the problem faced by traditional statistics: *what is the world like?*

The issue is that no amount of information about what the world is like can tell us how it will change.

The traditional understanding has been that causal inference is impossible outside the context of a randomized experiment. And, taken at face value, this is true. 

To understand the techniques used in modern causal inference, it's useful to constrast it to machine learning. Traditional machine learning is all about predictive inference.

This is very different from causal inference because predictive models look at the world as it exists on its own, while causal inference tries to guess how the world would respond to an outside intervention.


Suppose we are in charge of a fire department in a small town, and we 

The key idea needed to understand the notion of causal inference is the notion of an intervention.



Machine learning is focused on the task of *prediction*. It is designed to learn representations of the correlational structure of data.
