this is when the treatment works differently for different people

i don't understand the connection to causal inference, if there is one, but the econometrics people talk about this a lot

this is closely related to optimal policy estimation (which units to give which treatments, RL connection) see contextual bandits

which policy to apply to which subpopulation

multiple testing problems

if you know who it works for, that is a hint about how it works
