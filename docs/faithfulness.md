Converse of the [[local markov assumption]]. This assumption states that if two A and B are independent conditional on C, then they are d-separated by C in the graph. This is a crummy assumption because there are obvious counterexamples.

Example: if paths from A to D "cancel out", they will be independent in the dataset, even though there are not d-separated.
