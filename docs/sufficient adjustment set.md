Which covariates do you need to pay attention to?

We have a treatment t and an outcome y. Then w is a sufficient adjustment set if it is a set of covariates which blocks all backdoor paths from t to y. If we match on/control for the covariates in w, the we can get an estimate of the true causal effect.
