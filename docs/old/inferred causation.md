import DocLink from '@site/src/components/DocLink'

A variable A has a causal influence on a variable B if there is a directed path from A to B in every <DocLink to="minimality | minimal"/> <DocLink to="causal structure"/> that is consistent with the data.

This puts a lot of weight on <DocLink to="minimality"/>. I wonder if this is really justified...
