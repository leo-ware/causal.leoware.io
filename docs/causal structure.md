The fancy man's way of saying causal graph. Usually what we care about with these is what independencies they imply. This is a DAG; so it has no undirected edges.

A latent structure is a causal structure with a set of observed variables

Sometimes we organize these into equivalence classes--organized according to which independence assumptions they imply. We can represent one of these equivalence classes with a partially directed graph.
