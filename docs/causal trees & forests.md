A technique for estimating [[heterogeneous treatment effects]], kind of like decision trees, but predict treatment effect rather than outcome

sample splitting (honest estimation): determine the splits using half the data, calculate parameters for each treatment group using the other half
- costs bias, variance, MSE
- gives you a valid confidence interval
