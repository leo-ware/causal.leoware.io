A formal way of talking about how *simple* a theory is. It is a mathy version of Occam's Razor.

One [[causal structure | latent structure]] L is preferred to another L' iff L' can express all the probability distributions that L can. L is preferred if it is *less* expressive.

The set of probability distributions that a latent structure can express is determined by the independence constraints imposed by causal structure. So, one latent structure is preferred to another if it makes more requirements on which variables must be independent.

If we have a set S of latent structures, a member L of S is *minimal* w/r/t S iff no member of S is strictly preferred to L.

This is a super important concept. It is a big part of how [[Judea Pearl]] does [[causal discovery]].
